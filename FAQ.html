    <details style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 20%;">
       <summary><strong>How long did it take to make your costumes?</strong></summary>
       <p>Fun fact I haven't made any of my costumes since I sadly don't own a sewing machine, <br>I'm planning to learn how to sew and make props tho !</p>
   </details>
   <details style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 20%;">
       <summary><strong>How much did your costume cost?</strong></summary>
       <p> Costumes are just worth 1k + since I'd rather cosplay those characters with interesting designs muehe</p>
   </details>
    <details style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 20%;">
         <summary><strong>What materials do you use to make your costumes?</strong></summary>
       <p> As I said, I've never made costumes but I know a bit about costume making. Sewing machines are crucial, but if you're that determined; then you can embrace the beauty of hand sewing. I saw them using those patterns too for specific pieces, they probably buy it online and often make one by themselves which is beyond impressive.</p>

    <details style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 20%;">
        <summary><strong>How do you style your wig?</strong></summary>
       <p>haha, 2nd is looking for a reference to copy. But before I start snipping, I'd definitely learn how to snip hair and tie hairstyles accurately beforehand since that's the main point of wig styling, you have to be precise since. . . you're the beholder of the wig. You'd not want to wear something that's horribly done</p>

       <p>I get my costumes online, And props? So far i haven't managed one.</p>
    </details>
    <details style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 20%;">
       <summary><strong>Do you make all your cosplay your self?</strong></summary>
       <p> My answer is like number 1, I haven't done any costumes at all which is disappointing for me. I think I'd be more impressive if i gained dress making skills</p>
    </details>
    <details style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 20%;">
       <summary><strong>How do you deal with cosplay negativity or criticism?</strong></summary>
       <p>So far I haven't got criticized, which I'm grateful for. If ever I DID got criticized, thennn I think I'd be too busy for that type of stuff, I really just want to cosplay characters that I want to represent
